# Hi there!  I'm Sanket Suryawanshi  

**Innovative Developer | Problem Solver | ML & Web Enthusiast**  

I love building AI-driven projects that solve real-world problems Iâ€™ve personally encountered. From developing LangGraph-powered booking assistants and voice AI agents, to optimizing elevators with YOLO-based monitoring, and helping stray animals get urgent medical attention through AI-powered detection and reporting, I focus on creating impact-driven, intelligent solutions that merge Generative AI, computer vision, and automation.
