# Hi there!  I'm Sanket Suryawanshi  

**Innovative Developer | Problem Solver | ML & Web Enthusiast**  

I love building projects that solve real-world problems I've personally encountered. Whether it's optimizing elevators with real-time monitoring, streamlining online payments at fuel stations, or helping stray animals get the medical attention they need, I always aim to create impact-driven solutions.
